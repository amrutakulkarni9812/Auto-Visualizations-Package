# visualization package
This package is built on top of Python matplotlib library to create various visualizations for a given dataframe.
You need to pass: data file name, plot type, id variable name and metric/ output variable name to the plot_data function.
The code separates quantitative variables and categorical variables, drops the id variable since it is not useful for data analysis
and plots the type of chart you need with appropriate type of variables.

# Files
1. Generalvisualization.py
	This file contains Generic visualization class for commonly used visualization techniques, functions to read the data file, 
    separate data types and plot the charts based on use inputs.

2. Histogramvisualization.py
	This file contains the Histogram class and function to plot it for all quantitative variables.

3. Barchartvisualization.py
	This file contains Barchart class and functions to plot barchart for all categorical variables and stacked bar charts for categorical variable combinations.
    
4. Bubblechartvisualization.py
	This file contains Bubble chart class and function to plot correlation between two or more quantitative variables.
    
5. Piechartvisualization.py
	This file contains Pie chart class and function to plot distribution of one variable across categories of another variable.
	
6. Execution_code.py
